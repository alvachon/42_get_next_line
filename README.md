# GET_NEXT_LINE ![alvachon's 42 get_next_line Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/clb9zrpvt00250fl97rqy9hie/project/2639550) ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor (fd).

## Notice

Some requirements are specific to the project evaluation and are not friendly to use.\
[Here's how I implemented the same function in my libft](https://github.com/alvachon/42_libft/blob/main/libft/string/srcs/gnl.c)

### Don't forget:
* create a variable named "fd" when you need get_next_line
* calling open and close function in <fcntl.h>

## Installation

You will need valgrind for testing ;
* [Version for cluster's at 42](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/valgrind-macos)
* [Via brew](https://brew.sh/)

### Test
